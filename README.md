# Eat-Da-Burger: Burger Madness

1) Burger Madness is a restaurant app using utilizing MVC to show how relational databases can work. The skills used in this app are:
	* Node.js
	* Express
	* ORM
	* Handlebars
	* MySQL
	* Javascript
	* CSS
	This is a full-stack app that uses MySQL database, Node and Express to query and route the data in the back-end, and Handlebars and Javascript to handle UX and generate HTML. 

2) The app works by having users type in the name of their favorite burger. Upon hitting the submit button the burger will appear on the screen with a button that allows the user to "eat" the burger. Once the eaten button has been hit, the burger will move to the other side of the screen. 

3) All burgers created are stored in the MySQL database.
